    <p>
If your are <span class="narda-orange">looking for meals</span>: On Narda's homepage, make a search filtering by the day you want to eat. Browse through the options, select one and book it. That's it.
    <br/>
If you haven't logged in yet, you will be asked to do so, with your Facebook account. We don't ask for much information, this is just to validate your identity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
Once you book, you receive a confirmation email, with all the relevant information for your meal, including chef contact details. Then you can optionally get in contact with the chef. Please be responsive and only book if you are really going to attend. If, afer having booked, for some reason you really cannot make it, please let the chef know about it.

    <p>
If your are <span class="narda-orange">offering meals</span>: Please get in contact with us, send us an email to <a href="mailto:chefs@haveachef.com">chefs@haveachef.com</a> and we will call you back. This is due to the extra care we want to have with our chefs to maintain the quality of our site.
    <br/>
    <br/>
For now we are offering the service only in Amsterdam, in the Nederlands. More cities to come, however.

    <br/>
    <br/>
Enjoy your meal!

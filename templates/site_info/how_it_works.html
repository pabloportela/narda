On Narda's homepage, make a search filtering by the desired date and place. Browse through the options, select one and book it.

        <h4 class="narda-orange"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-log-in narda-blue"></span> &nbsp; Log in if you haven't</h4>
        <p>
If you haven't logged in yet, you will be asked to do so, with your Facebook account. We don't ask for much information, this is just to validate your identity.

        <h4 class="narda-orange"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check narda-blue"></span> &nbsp; Book it</h4>
        <p>
Once you book, you receive a confirmation email, with all the relevant information for your meal, including chef contact details. Then you can optionally get in contact with the chef.

      Yeah, enjoy your meal, dude.
